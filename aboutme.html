    My passion for journalism began in elementary school. Every morning before school, my mom would have the Today Show on, and I was mesmerized by the anchors and the stories they told. At the time, I had no idea what journalism was, so I didn’t think much about it. That changed in eighth grade when high school counselors visited to help us choose freshman-year classes. And there it was on the elective list— "Intro to Broadcasting."
